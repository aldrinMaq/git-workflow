# Our horoscope
Eclipse season reminder: change is good, Aries. Change is always good—even if it doesn’t manifest in the way that you imagine.
Buckle your seatbelt and get ready for a wild ride. You’re going to be so, so grateful you did. At the same time,
pay attention to areas of your life where you’re feeling “stuck”. Take a good look in the mirror and ask yourself the tough
questions. Remember, you’re stronger, braver and sexier than you give yourself credit for. Don’t hold yourself back in any way.
