Everything we consume affects our vibration, from the food we eat to the books we read. Needless to say, our friend circle plays 
an essential role in determining our state of being. This brings us to the most important question: who are you surrounding 
yourself with at the moment? Are you in the company of those who make you feel seen, heard and witnessed? The kind of people 
who stand by you through the bad times *and* celebrate your victories like their own? Two words: choose wisely. 
At the same time, if you feel like there’s a friend who’s been having a hard time or been MIA for a bit, now is a good time to 
reach out to them.
